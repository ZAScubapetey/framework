                • the misuse of the terminals by the Customer or his/its clientele, a fault, negligence, omission or

                incurred by
                the

                the date on
                which the claim arose. In no event shall Framwork.sh be liable for any lost profits, or any special,
                indirect,
                consequential,

                reason
                whatsoever,
                including reasons not explicitly mentioned hereunder.<br><br>
              </p>
              <h5>SECTION 4: CUSTOMER’S OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES</h5>
              <p><br>
                The Customer agrees to use his/its power, authority and capabilities to enter into this Agreement and
                perform
                his/its obligations as provided hereunder.<br>
                The Customer agrees to communicate to Framwork.sh his/its accurate and updated contact information upon
                the
                creation
                of the Customer Account and each time such information is modified.
                Framwork.sh reserves the right to request supporting documentation from the Customer to ensure the
                accuracy of
                their
                information.<br>
                The Customer is solely and exclusively responsible for the passwords that are required in order to use
                the
                Service.
                Framwork.sh is not responsible for the illegal or fraudulent use of passwords made available to the
                Customer. The
                passwords provided are considered confidential. The Customer shall be solely liable, at the exclusion of
                Framwork.sh, in
                the event of any suspicion that the passwords provided have been disclosed, whether intentionally or
                not.<br>
                The Customer alone shall bear all the consequences of a malfunction of the Service resulting from the
                use by
                his/its staff or by any other person to whom the Customer has provided his/its password(s). The Customer
                shall
                also bear all the consequences resulting from the loss of such password(s).<br>
                The Customer hereby agrees to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements in force, and, more
                specifically,
                with those pertaining to software, files, freedom and intellectual property, as well as the rights of
                third
                parties. The
                Customer also agrees to take out all required insurance policies from a well known solvent insurer, in
                order to
                cover all damages attributable to the Customer in connection with this Agreement or the performance
                thereof.
                The Customer hereby fully accepts all legal obligations arising from the administration of their
                Services.
                Framwork.sh
                cannot be held liable or investigated in this respect for any reason, especially in the event of a
                violation of
                the laws
                or regulations applicable to the Customer's Services. Non-compliance by the Customer with the
                aforementioned
                points detailed in Special Conditions, and especially with any activity likely to generate a civil
                and/or penal
                liability will give Framwork.sh the right to immediately disconnect and/or stop the Customer's Services
                without
                prior notice,
                and to immediately and lawfully terminate this Agreement, without prejudice to the right to all damages
                and
                interest that Framwork.sh may claim.<br>
                The Customer undertakes to settle directly with a claimant, any sum demanded from Framwork.sh by such
                claimant.
                Moreover, the Customer undertakes to intervene at the request of Framwork.sh in any proceedings brought
                against
                Framwork.sh
                and shall indemnify and hold harmless Framwork.sh from any and all such third party claims.
                Consequently, the
                Customer
                undertakes to address any third party complaint and/or procedure, regardless of form, object or nature,
                that is
                brought against Framwork.sh and is related to the Customer's obligations under this Agreement.<br>
                The Customer hereby agrees to inform Framwork.sh within 48 hours of any changes in his/its situation,
                and within
                24
                hours, of any lost passwords.<br>
                Whenever contacting Framwork.sh, the Customer agrees to clearly describe his/its request in compliance
                with the
                terms of
                use.<br>
                When suspicious activity (SPAM, violation of copyright, Attack, Phishing, illegal content, DoS PortScan
                ...) is
                detected by Framwork.sh or reported by a third party, Framwork.sh may contact the Client by email (and
                optionally
                attach a copy
                of the complaint received). It is expected that the Client respond to the notification within the time
                limit (24,
                48 or
                72 hours depending on the nature of the case) to provide its comments and intentions. Failure to respond
                could
                result in the suspension / termination of service.<br><br>

                Preliminary checks:<br>
                In the event of Service malfunction, it is the Customer’s responsibility to consult the Documentation
                and perform
                the technical tests suggested by Framwork.sh on the Framwork.sh Site in the contact tools. If the
                malfunction
                problem
                encountered persists, the Customer shall have the responsibility of reporting the Incident to
                Framwork.sh.<br>
                <strong>5.2</strong> Incident Reporting Procedure:<br>
                In order to report an Incident, the Customer shall complete the form designed for such purpose on the
                website,
                then go to the Customer’s Management Interface where earlier tickets of electronic exchanges between the
                Customer and Framwork.sh may be found.<br>
                The Customer shall complete the form on he Framwork.sh Site and attempt to provide as much information
                as possible
                on
                the problem encountered to help with the Diagnostic.<br>
                To this end, the Customer explicitly authorizes Framwork.sh and its staff to connect to the Customer’s
                Service and
                to
                perform any operation required in connection with the Diagnostic, with respect to both the hardware and
                the
                software. Framwork.sh reserves the right to reject any intervention in this regard if Framwork.sh
                notices in its
                research work that
                the Customer uses the Service in breach of General and Specific Terms and Conditions or of laws and
                regulations in force.<br>
                All the exchanges between the parties, and more particularly the electronic exchanges and telephone
                conversations, shall reflect Customer’s assent to intervention.<br>
                <strong>5.3</strong> Incident Takeover and Development of Diagnostic<br>
                Framwork.sh shall, in connection with the Incident reporting procedure, carry out a Diagnostic in order
                to
                determine the
                origin and cause of the malfunction problem. If, during the Diagnostic process, Framwork.sh concludes
                that the
                malfunction is an Incident, namely that it is a problem under the responsibility of Framwork.sh, the
                costs related
                to the
                Diagnostic process shall be entirely borne by Framwork.sh, in compliance with the Agreement terms and
                conditions
                applicable to the Service.<br>
                Alternatively, if the Diagnostic reveals that Framwork.sh does not bear responsibility for the Incident
                encountered by the
                Customer or that its existence cannot be confirmed the time spent by Framwork.sh on carrying out the
                Diagnostic
                will be
                invoiced to the Customer at a flat rate available for consultation noted on Website.<br>
                In the event of Framwork.sh being unable to identify the origin or the cause of the incident, the
                investigations
                relating to
                production of the Diagnostic will not be invoiced to the Customer if Framwork.sh is unable to identify
                the cause
                of the
                dysfunction, or if Framwork.sh is unable to provide the customer with a quotation for the correction of
                the
                malfunction.
                Likewise, the Diagnostic will not be invoiced to the Customer if Framwork.sh is unable to provide a
                quotation for
                the
                correction of the incident.<br>
                The Customer undertakes not to improperly make use of the Technical Assistance. Framwork.sh reserves the
                right to
                refuse to handle a Customer request if their conduct or the frequency of their requests is likely to
                adversely
                affect
                the normal operation of the Technical Assistance Service.<br>
                The Customer agrees to avoid using the Technical Support service in an abusive manner. Framwork.sh
                reserves the
                right
                to refuse to respond to a Customer’s claim if the Customer’s behaviour or the frequency of claims is
                likely to
                disrupt the normal operations of the Technical Support service.<br>
                <strong>5.4</strong> Resolution of Malfunction<br>
                At the end of the Diagnostic, Framwork.sh shall inform the Customer on the cause of the malfunction and
                indicate
                which
                technical solutions will be used to resolve the problem encountered.<br>
                At the end of the Diagnostic, Framwork.sh will convey the cause of the malfunction and will direct the
                Customer to
                the
                technical solutions for resolving the problem encountered.<br>
                In the event of Framwork.sh not bearing the responsibility for the Malfunction, Framwork.sh will forward
                a
                quotation to the
                Customer corresponding to the cost of the resolution operations, if the Customer wants Framwork.sh to
                take charge
                of
                resolving its problem.<br>
                As previously stated, Framwork.sh only has an obligation of means.<br>
                <strong>5.5</strong> Conditions of payment<br>
                The base price of the quotation is set out on the Framwork.sh Site. The sums due will be invoiced
                monthly on the
                anniversary date of technical support being received for the Service. In the event of monthly renewal of
                the
                Service, all sums due relating to this Service, including technical support, will be invoiced.<br>
                No new interventions will be carried out if the payment of the preceding intervention has not been
                honoured.<br><br>
              </p>
              <h5>SECTION 6: TERM AND RENEWAL OF SERVICE, RATES</h5>

                the
                Service at
                any time. Framwork.sh shall, to the extent possible, notify in advance the Service users, through a
                message on the
                mailing
                list created in connection with the beta-test, on website or forum, or by any other means Framwork.sh
                deems
                necessary.<br>
                <strong>6.2</strong> Service Renewal<br>
                Framwork.sh may possibly not renew its Service at the end of the term. Framwork.sh shall make every
                effort to
                inform the
                Customer beforehand regarding this and shall delete all the data stored by the Customer on the Service.
                The
                Customer hereby agrees to recover all his/its data prior to the end of the Service term.<br>
                Any non-payment or irregular payment, meaning incorrect or incomplete amounts in particular, or lacking
                the
                required references, or made by any method or procedure not accepted by Framwork.sh are not acceptable
                and will
                result
                in rejection by Framwork.sh of the registration or renewal request.<br>
                Concerning renewals paid by cheque, it is up to the Customer to request the renewal with sufficient time
                for the
                cheque to be received and processed by Framwork.sh prior to expiration of the Service. Framwork.sh
                reminds the
                Customer that
                the processing of a payment by cheque may take more than 5 working days in some cases.<br>
                <strong>6.3</strong> Rates<br>
                Framwork.sh will invoice the Customer for the setup fees of any Framework.sh bare-metal server order.
                These fees
                correspond particularly to setting up and configuring the server, according to the operating system
                chosen by the
                Customer.<br>
                After each payment, Framwork.sh will send an invoice by email and/or will make it available to the
                Customer via
                their
                management Interface. The Customer expressly accepts that the invoice will be sent to them
                electronically.<br>
                <br>
                Framwork.sh reserves the right to modify their prices at any time, subject to informing the Customer by
                email
                and/or to
                making an online announcement on the Framwork.sh Site one month in advance, if the new prices excluding
                tax are
                less
                favourable to the Customer. In this event, the Customer will have one month from receipt of this
                information to
                cancel their contract without penalty. Failing any such action by the Customer, the Customer will be
                deemed to
                have accepted the new rates. Price changes will apply to all Agreements, and especially ongoing
                Agreements.<br>
                Framwork.sh reserves the right to pass on any new tax or any increase in existing taxes without
                delay.<br>
                The Services provided by Framwork.sh are payable at the time of ordering. The Customer is solely
                responsible for
                payment of all sums due under the Agreement for Framwork.sh Services. By express agreement and unless
                deferment is
                requested in good time and specifically granted by Framwork.sh in writing, the total or partial
                non-payment of any
                sum due
                under the Agreement by the due date will automatically result in the following, without prior
                notification:
                - immediate payment of any outstanding amounts owed by the Customer under the Agreement, regardless
                of the planned method of payment;<br>
                - suspension of all ongoing services, regardless of their nature, without prejudice to the ability of
                Framwork.sh
                to

                Framwork.sh reserves the right to restrict, limit or suspend its services without prior notice nor
                indemnity if it
                appears that

                Agreement
                with Framwork.sh or the Service objectives.<br>
                The Service may also be restricted, limited or suspended when the specific terms and conditions
                applicable to a
                type of Service offered by Framwork.sh provide for such sanctions in the event of a breach.<br>
                The restriction, limitation or suspension measures shall always be taken in accordance with the
                seriousness or
                recurrence of the breach(es), and shall be based on the nature of such breach(es).<br>

                with the laws
                and
                regulations in force.<br>
                Either Party may terminate the Agreement, as of right and without indemnity, in the case of a Force

                maintenance of
                security
                or stability on hosting platform. Framwork.sh shall, to the extent possible, give the Customer prior
                notice
                regarding
                such interruption.<br>
                Framwork.sh reserves the right to interrupt the Service, as needed, for technical interventions designed

              <p><br>
                The Customer hereby acknowledges that bandwidth fluctuations and problems with the access provider could
                cause a gap in the services provided by the Framwork.sh Corporation, which it would be unable to
                resolve.
                However, the Service shall be restricted, limited or suspended, as of right, by Framwork.sh:<br>

                • in compliance with the applicable Specific Terms and Conditions;<br>

                authority,
                in
                compliance with the appropriate applicable laws, or from a third party;<br>

              <h5>SECTION 10: TOLERANCE</h5>
              <p><br>
                The fact that Framwork.sh fails to invoke one of the General Terms and Conditions of Service and/or
                tolerates the
                violation
                by the other Party of any of the obligations hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver to invoke in

                addresses” shall be kept by Framwork.sh during the entire term of the Agreement and up to twelve (12)

                Customer’s

              <h5>SECTION 12: AMENDMENTS</h5>
              <p><br>
                The General and Specific Terms and Conditions online take precedence over the printed General and
                Specific
                Terms and Conditions. The parties agree that Framwork.sh may, as of right, bring changes to its Service
                simply by

                sent via
                e-mail to
